* General Testing
[ ] Activation vs regularization on the re-parameterization
[ ] Test cifar dataset
[ ] Add 2d cluster demo again, and see improvements for rho-based models
[ ] Add chairs
[ ] Test denoising / contracting performance??
[ ] Try a Resnet-like based encoder


* Code fixes
[X] Fix hacks
[X] Expand the data loader
[X] Fix the num_class, input_shape hack
[ ] Write out generator examples at end of run
[ ] Switch to snakemake instead of batch scripts
[ ] Reintroduce visdom with a switch


* Bugs DCGAN model
[ ] Fix num class again, pass, the parameter nicely
[X] Fix fashion MNIST, NaN on BCE
[X] UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([128, 784])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([128, 1, 28, 28])) is deprecated. Please ensure they have the same size.
  BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x.view(-1, data_dim), reduction='sum')


* Strategy
[ ] Investigate flows
[ ] Other rho matrices / inverse weishart distribution
[ ] Bernouilli reparam


* Code todo
[ ] Find out why infovae/dcgan architecture doesn't give an advantage
[X] Add Fashion MNIST to the data options
[X] Make identifier for orchestration
[X] Add DCGAN encoder/decoder
[ ] Add Killer VEA architecture
[X] Add the (lr) schedular and reduce on plateau
[ ] Add early stopping again
[X] Add saving the best model according to the validation loss
[ ] Add latent space visualization
[X] Make identifier for orchestration
[ ] Add Killer VEA architecture
[X] Add InfoVEA architecture
[X] Add beta vae architecture
[ ] Add chair dataset to loaders
[ ] Integrate visdom again
[ ] Better orchestration
