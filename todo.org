* Code fixes
[X] Fix hacks
[X] Expand the data loader
[X] Fix the num_class, input_shape hack


* bugs DCGAN model
[ ] Fix fashion MNIST, NaN on BCE
[X] UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([128, 784])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([128, 1, 28, 28])) is deprecated. Please ensure they have the same size.
  BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x.view(-1, data_dim), reduction='sum')
