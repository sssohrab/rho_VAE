* Code fixes
[X] Fix hacks
[ ] Expand the data loader
[ ] Fix the num_class, input_shape hack


* bugs DCGAN model
[ ] UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([128, 784])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([128, 1, 28, 28])) is deprecated. Please ensure they have the same size.
  BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x.view(-1, data_dim), reduction='sum')


* Code todo
[ ] Make identifier for orchestration
[X] Add DCGAN encoder/decoder
[ ] Add Killer VEA architecture
[ ] Add the (lr) schedular and reduce on plateau
[ ] Add early stopping again
[ ] Add saving the best model according to the validation loss
[ ] Make identifier for orchestration
[ ] Add Killer VEA architecture
[X] Add InfoVEA architecture


* Tests
[ ] test cifar dataset
[ ] Add 2d cluster demo again, and see improvements for rho-based models
